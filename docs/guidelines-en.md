# üìò Single Owner Anti-Pattern Guidelines PHP 8.4^

## üéØ Purpose
This document is a guideline for building a pipeline system in PHP 8.4^ based on the **single owner** principle. The principle ensures that every piece of data has **only one owner** (refcount ~ 1 ‚Üí 0), every variable must be **moved** once it is used, and no data is allowed to remain alive without an owner. All output must go through a **verified frame mechanism** with the pattern `START‚ÄìEND + token + length (+ checksum)`, which guarantees that **echo statements or debug noise will never leak into STDOUT**.

---

## üß© Core Ideas

1. **Linear Flow**
    - **Goal:** Ensure all data flows through a single linear execution path. Each stage consumes the data from the previous stage and produces new data for the next stage.
    - **Setup:** Once a variable is consumed, it must be replaced by a new result. No reuse or branching of data is allowed.

2. **Ephemeral Data**
    - **Goal:** Treat all variables as temporary and short-lived, with no long-term caching inside the process.
    - **Setup:** Any data that needs to persist must be stored outside the process (e.g., Redis or temporary files).

3. **Move Semantics**
    - **Goal:** Enforce that every assignment is treated as a transfer of ownership, not a duplication.
    - **Setup:** Once a variable is moved, it must not be accessed again. Refcount always drops to zero after the move.

4. **Framed Contract**
    - **Goal:** Guarantee that all output data is wrapped in a frame with clear metadata to validate integrity.
    - **Setup:** Every payload must be wrapped with `START‚ÄìEND` markers, including `token`, `length`, and checksum/HMAC.

5. **Anti-Caching / Anti-Sharing**
    - **Goal:** Prevent internal caching or variable sharing inside the PHP process.
    - **Setup:** All data must be single-use. If caching is required, it must live outside the process and be immutable.

6. **Memory as a Transit Area**
    - **Goal:** Use memory only as a transit zone, not as storage.
    - **Setup:** Data must be processed and discarded immediately. No data should remain idle in memory.

7. **Deterministic Execution**
    - **Goal:** Guarantee that the same input always produces the same output.
    - **Setup:** Normalize data (e.g., sorted associative keys, consistent float formatting) so results are deterministic.

8. **Trade-offs**
    - **Goal:** Understand that the single owner principle increases CPU overhead (validation, recomputation) but significantly reduces memory usage.
    - **Setup:** Benchmark with large payloads to measure the balance between CPU cost and memory efficiency.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Pitfalls and Fixes

- **Third-party libraries using echo or global state.**
    - *Pitfall:* Echo noise or global state can break single-owner discipline.
    - *Fix:* Drop foreign OB levels, audit superglobals, and enforce all output through framing.

- **Expensive recomputation.**
    - *Pitfall:* Without internal caching, recomputation can be costly.
    - *Fix:* Allow external caching (Redis, temp files) with short TTL as new sources.

- **Copy-on-Write in PHP.**
    - *Pitfall:* Small mutations on large arrays can trigger expensive copies.
    - *Fix:* Use streaming approaches, minimize mutations, and avoid string concatenation in loops.

- **Ambiguous length in UTF-8.**
    - *Pitfall:* Character length differs from byte length.
    - *Fix:* Always use byte length and record encoding in frame headers.

- **Weak CRC32 checksum.**
    - *Pitfall:* CRC32 is collision-prone.
    - *Fix:* Add HMAC-SHA256 for critical data integrity checks.

- **Regex parsing on large buffers.**
    - *Pitfall:* Regex becomes CPU heavy at scale.
    - *Fix:* Replace with a linear state-machine parser.

- **No caching increases latency.**
    - *Pitfall:* Always recomputing data slows execution.
    - *Fix:* Allow external immutable caching as sources.

    - *Pitfall:* Long-running processes can fragment memory.
    - *Fix:* Recycle processes after a certain number of frames.

- **Non-deterministic serialization.**
    - *Pitfall:* Key ordering, floats, and locale can cause inconsistent output.
    - *Fix:* Normalize arrays, enforce float formatting, and fix locale.

- **High Time-To-First-Byte (TTFB).**
    - *Pitfall:* Flushing only at the end increases latency.
    - *Fix:* Use chunked flushing (64‚Äì256 KB) with per-chunk validation.

- **STDOUT blocking with slow consumers.**
    - *Pitfall:* Slow consumers can cause blocking or deadlock.
    - *Fix:* Apply backpressure policies and timeouts.

- **Weak or predictable tokens.**
    - *Pitfall:* Predictable tokens can be exploited.
    - *Fix:* Generate random tokens from CSPRNG with short lifetimes.
